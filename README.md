# hello-world
Hello world! I'm creating my first repository. 
This is an interesting process because at the moment, I'm simply following the instructions on the other side of my screen.  
Oh, so describing my changes.  I first recreated a repository.  Then I made a copy of that repository by clicking on the branches icon, typing in what I want to create and hitting 'create branch' from: master.
